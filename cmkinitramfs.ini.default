# Configuration file for cmkinitramfs and cmkinit
#
# This program determines the init process with data sources and dependencies.
# A data source is any form of data storage, it can be a filesystem, a LVM
# volume, a LUKS partition, a file, .... All data sources are defined in this
# configuration file, a section in this file corresponds to a data source
# (except for the [DEFAULT] section).
#


# Global configuration, this section is required

# Optionnal: Override the directory used to build the initramfs.
#build-dir = /tmp/initramfs

# Select the data source to use as root, this configuration is required
# This is the name of the data source, the name of a data source is determined
# by the name of the section it is configured in (e.g. [data-source-name],
# without the brackets).
